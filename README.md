# metro-jobs-rss

This repository takes the job list from [jobs.metro.net/jobsearchRSS.aspx](jobs.metro.net/jobsearchRSS.aspx) and republishes it at a URL with a `.xml` extension:

https://lacmta.github.io/metro-jobs-rss/jobsearchRSS.xml

*Update*
This RSS file was needed for emailing lists of jobs via Active Campaign.  We don't use Active Campaign anymore so the CRON job has been turned off.
